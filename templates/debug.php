	// This is a lightweight Debugging template. It basically just demonstrates
	// how to use the debugging mechanisms provided by $Painfree.

	// In most cases, you would really only want to have your primary
	// template load a debugging template like this during development
	// or for your development account. Use your own judgement.

	// this is an example just for fun. You can call $Painfree->debug()
	// wherever you want in your application and it would theoretically
	// be displayed in this template.
