PHPainfree
==========

PHPainfree is an **ultra**-lightweight PHP framework. It is inspired by the
MVC concept and attempts to remove barriers to entry while providing the
flexibility to design, develop, and deploy applications of any size or
complexity.

Version 2 comes with a significant shift in opinion, focused on developer
productivity and happiness. Whenever possible, we follow a [HATEOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS)
approach to software development, and Version 2 of PHPainfree comes bundled
with "opinions" and options on how to build modern, functional web applications.

This version comes embedded with [htmx](https://htmx.org) and has significant
improvements to the underlying PHP library design to make use of the `htmx` 
system of partial content swaps with `htmx` magic. You're still free, as always,
to roll your own mechanisms for anything, but we've provided a more robust
set of defaults to show you a different way to build PHP software products.
